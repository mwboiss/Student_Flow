## Notes on "A New Weighting Scheme in Weighted Markov Model for Predicting the Probability of Drought Episodes"

### Motivation: This was read to assess the mechanism of using a weighted markov chain to account for the sequential nature of student flow. Each year in a students progression from year 1 to 6 being a different set of circumstances. As time goes on the proportions of students who graduate at a 6 year rate changes and using data from too far back to make predictions on current students becomes less effective. Possibly weighting the transition probabilities as they become less relevant to the present might be a good path forward.
